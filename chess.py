# This code sets up a basic chatbot that can respond to English language input. 
# To make your chatbot more intelligent and capable of beating a person in a conversation, 
# you would need to implement more advanced NLP techniques and possibly integrate 
# machine learning models that can learn from interactions.

# Remember, the ChatterBot library is a good starting point, but for a more 
# sophisticated AI, you might want to explore other libraries like spaCy, NLTK, 
# or even machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

# Please note that the ChatterBot library hasn’t been actively maintained for a while, 
# so you might encounter issues that require workarounds or fixes. For a more up-to-date solution, 
# you might consider using APIs like OpenAI’s GPT-3 or Cohere, 
# which offer more advanced conversational capabilities.
